Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.\n\n## Integration capabilities:\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint allows you to perform preventative protection, post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response.\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint delivers continuous asset visibility, intelligent risk-based assessments, and built-in remediation tools to help your security and IT teams prioritize and address critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across your organization.\n\n## What does this pack do?\n\n- Receives alerts from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as XSOAR incidents\n- Enriches IOCs from XSOAR to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and vice versa\n- Allows remediation actions for connected endpoints\n- Provides investigation capabilities on connected assets\n- Allows asset visibility, status, and health (vulnerability assessment) \n\n## Content Pack components\n\n- The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration imports events as XSOAR incidents.\n- The Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection Get Machine Action Status playbook uses generic polling to get machine action information (relevant for Cortex XSOAR v6.2 and earlier).\n- The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Isolate Endpoint playbook accepts an endpoint ID, IP address, or hostname and isolates it using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration (relevant for Cortex XSOAR v6.2 and earlier).\n- The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Unisolate Endpoint playbook accepts an endpoint ID, IP address, or hostname and unisolates it using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration (relevant for Cortex XSOAR v6.2 and earlier).\n\n## Authentication\n\nFor more details about the authentication used for components in this content pack, see [Microsoft Integrations - Authentication](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/microsoft-integrations---authentication).\n\n### Endpoint URL\n\n\n| **Environment Type** | **Endpoint URL**                            |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n | Worldwide                | \u003chttps://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com\u003e    |\n | Us Geo Proximity         | \u003chttps://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com\u003e    |\n | Eu Geo Proximity         | \u003chttps://api-eu.securitycenter.microsoft.com\u003e |\n | UK Geo Proximity         | \u003chttps://api-uk.securitycenter.microsoft.com\u003e |\n | Us GCC                   | \u003chttps://api-gcc.securitycenter.microsoft.us\u003e |\n | Us GCC-High              | \u003chttps://api-gcc.securitycenter.microsoft.us\u003e |\n | DoD                      | \u003chttps://api-gov.securitycenter.microsoft.us\u003e |\n\nTo find the appropriate Endpoint URI, use the following resources:\n\n- For Worldwide or Geo Proximity URLs, see [Supported Microsoft 365 Defender APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-supported?view=o365-worldwide#endpoint-uris)\n- For Us Government \u0026 DoD URLs, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for US Government customers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/gov?view=o365-worldwide#api)\n\n## Log ingestion\n\nNote: In order to parse the timestamp correctly, make sure that the timestamp field is in UTC time zone (timestamp ends with \"Z\").\nThe supported time format are yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:%E3S (2021-12-08 10:00:00.123Z) or yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss (2021-07-01T10:00:00Z). The relevant field is \"lastEventTime\".\n\n\n## Licence information\n\nAvailable for E3, E5, and standalone licenses.\n",
